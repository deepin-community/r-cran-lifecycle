Description: manage the life cycle of your GNU R package functions
 Manage the life cycle of your exported functions with
 shared conventions, documentation badges, and non-invasive
 deprecation warnings. The 'lifecycle' package defines four
 development stages (experimental, maturing, stable, and
 questioning) and three deprecation stages (soft-deprecated,
 deprecated, and defunct). It makes it easy to insert badges
 corresponding to these stages in your documentation. Usage of
 deprecated functions are signalled with increasing levels of
 non-invasive verbosity.
